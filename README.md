XMLDB

@Author: ZHU, Chenfeng

This is my homework for XML Database and Semantic Web.

Assignment 01: The purpose of this assignment is to apply DTD, XML Schema (including keys/keyrefs), XPath and XQuery to perform typical tasks towards developing a data-intensive information system that relies on XML databases and views over them.

Assignment 02: The purpose of this assignment is to apply XHTML, XSLT, CSS, and KML to perform typical tasks towards developing a data-intensive information system that relies on XML databases and views over them.

Assignment 03: There is no Assignment 03. I just used the knowledge about Keys for XML and Semantic Web to solve some problems and describe information.
